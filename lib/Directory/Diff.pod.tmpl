=head1 NAME

Directory::Diff - recursively find differences between similar directories

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% INCLUDE "synopsis.pl" | xtidy %]

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Directory::Diff version [% version %],
corresponding to git commit [% commit.commit %] at [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Directory::Diff finds differences between two directories and all
their subdirectories, recursively. If it finds a file with the same
name in both directories, it uses L<File::Compare> to find out whether
they are different. It is callback-based and takes actions only if
required.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The main function of this module is L</directory_diff>. The other
functions are helper functions, but these can be exported on request.

=head2 ls_dir

     my %ls = ls_dir ("dir");

C<ls_dir> makes a hash containing a true value for each file and
directory which is found under the directory given as the first
argument.

It also has an option to print messages on what it finds, by setting a
second argument to a true value, for example

     my %ls = ls_dir ("dir", 1);

=head2 get_only

     my %only = get_only (\%dir1, \%dir2);

Given two hashes containing true values for each file or directory
under two directories, return a hash containing true values for the
files and directories which are in the first directory hash but not in
the second directory hash.

For example, if

     %dir1 = ("file" => 1, "dir/" => 1, "dir/file" => 1);

and 

     %dir2 = ("dir/" => 1, "dir2/" => 1);

C<get_only> returns

     %only = ("file" => 1, "dir/file" => 1);

There is also a third option which prints messages on what is found if
set to a true value, for example,

     my %only = get_only (\%dir1, \%dir2, 1);

=head2 get_diff

     my %diff = get_diff ("dir1", \%dir1_ls, "dir2", \%dir2_ls);

Get a list of files which are in both C<dir1> and C<dir2>, but which
are different. This uses L<File::Compare> to test the files for
differences. It searches subdirectories. Usually the hashes
C<%dir1_ls> and C<%dir2_ls> are those output by L</ls_dir>.

=head2 directory_diff

     directory_diff ("dir1", "dir2", 
                     {dir1_only => \&dir1_only,
                      diff => \& diff});

Given two directories F<dir1> and F<dir2>, this calls back a
user-supplied routine for each of three cases:

=over

=item A file is only in the first directory

In this case a callback specified by C<dir1_only> is called once

     &{$third_arg->{dir1_only}} ($third_arg->{data}, "dir1", $file);

for each file C<$file> which is in F<dir1> but not in F<dir2>,
including files in subdirectories.

=item A file is only in the second directory

In this case a callback specified by C<dir2_only> is called once

     &{$third_arg->{dir2_only}} ($third_arg->{data}, "dir2", $file);

for each file C<$file> which is in F<dir2> but not in F<dir1>,
including files in subdirectories.

=item A file with the same name but different contents is in both directories

In this case a callback specified by C<diff> is called once

     &{$third_arg->{diff}} ($third_arg->{data}, "dir1", "dir2", $file);

for each file name C<$file> which is in both F<dir1> and in F<dir2>,
including files in subdirectories.

=back

The first argument to each of the callback functions is specified by
C<data>. The second argument to C<dir1_only> and C<dir2_only> is the
directory's name. The third argument is the file name, which includes
the subdirectory part. The second and third arguments to C<diff> are
the two directories, and the fourth argument is the file name
including the subdirectory part.

If the user does not supply a callback, no action is taken, even if a
file is found.

The routine does not return a meaningful value. It does not check the
return values of the callbacks. Therefore if it is necessary to stop
midway, the user must use something like C<eval { }> and C<die>.

A fourth argument, if set to any true value, causes directory_diff to
print messages about what it finds and what it does.

=head2 default_dir_only

     use Directory::Diff qw/directory_diff default_dir_only/;
     directory_diff ('old', 'new', {dir1_only => \&default_dir_only});

A simple routine to print out when a file is only in one of the
directories. This is for testing the C<Directory::Diff> module.

=head2 default_diff

     use Directory::Diff qw/directory_diff default_diff/;
     directory_diff ('old', 'new', {dir1_only => \&default_diff});

A simple routine to print out when a file is different between the
directories. This is for testing the C<Directory::Diff> module.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 CPAN modules

=over

=item L<File::DirCompare>

This seemingly does a very similar thing to Directory::Diff.

=item L<File::Dircmp>

=head1 MOTIVATION

The reason I wrote this module is because C<< `diff --recursive` >>
stops when it finds a subdirectory which is in one directory and not
the other, without descending into the subdirectory. For example, if
one has a file like C<dir1/subdir/file>,

     diff -r dir1 dir2

will tell you "Only in dir1: subdir" but it won't tell you anything
about the files under "subdir".

I needed to go down into the subdirectory and find all the files which
were in all the subdirectories, so I wrote this.

I've been using this module for updating web sites with a lot of pages
since 2009. I keep a local copy of the uploaded web site in a
directory like F<old-site>, and then rebuild all the pages in another
directory like F<new-site>, then I use L<Directory::Diff::Copy> to put
the changed files into yet another directory, like
F<changed-site-files>. Once the changed files are copied, then I tar,
gzip, and upload the directory of changed files, and untar it at the
web host. I'm currently using this for almost all the static content
for the following web sites: L<http://www.sljfaq.org>,
L<http://kanji.sljfaq.org>, and L<http://www.lemoda.net>. I put this
module on github in about 2012 and on CPAN in 2016.
